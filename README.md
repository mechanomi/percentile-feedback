# Percentile Feedback

Percentile feedback implementation

## About

Based on code by Nick Winter, made available under the Apache License 2.0.

## Setup

Run `log.py SECONDS` to log a period of time.

This will create a `periods.txt` file (your time data) and a corresponding `periods.js` file.

Open `index.js` to see your percentile feedback graph.
